# Playing with Angular Material Autocomplete Demo
- Install NVM if node.js is not installed.
- Install packages in `bower.json` and `packages.json`

```
bower install .
npm install .
```

- These are just some notes on how the setup was created.
  - Ran `node_modules/karma/bin/karma init`. Answer a bunch of questions.
  - Ensure that `karma.conf.js` has all the necessary files mentioned.
  - Normally this matches the same list of angular files

- Running a test

```
./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start
```
